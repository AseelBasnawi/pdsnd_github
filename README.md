### Explore US Bikeshare Data
In this project, we use Python to explore data related to the bike share systems of three major cities - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and compute descriptive statistics. We run a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal.


### Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. The data files contain the same core six columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

* The Chicago and New York City files also provide the additional following two columns:

* Gender

* Birth Year

### Files used
* chicago.csv

* new_york_city.csv

* washington.csv
